# portfolio

## Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?

I began my process by laying out the basic structure of the site, figuring out how many pages I want to make and if that goal was realistic for my deadlines. Once that was complete I added the details such as colour, pictures, and consutization. Some times I would get stuck on a part of my code that wouldn't work, if I really couldn't figure it out I moved on to a different part of the project and came back to the issue with fresh eyes in order to resolve it. I've learned a lot while making this porfolio, especially since this was my first time using Bootstrap on my own project. I learned how to quickly problem solve and find alternatives to reach my end goal and I am happy with the end result.
